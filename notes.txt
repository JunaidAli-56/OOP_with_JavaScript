Constructor Property
 - we write Strings in Js like ["",''',``] but js read like that 
 * new String();
 * new Boolean(); ..[true or false]
 * new Number(); [1,2,3]


Functions are Objects
 * Every object in javascript has a constructor property.
 * and that references the function are use to create an object

 - these two expression are equal 
 * new Circle3(1);
 * Circle3.call({}, 1) // in this line this will reference is {} which we pass in Circle3 , 1 is an arugument
 * Circle3.call({}, 1,2,3,3,4) // if we have multiple aruguments.
